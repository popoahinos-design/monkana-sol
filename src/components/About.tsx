                🐵 <strong>Monky is the symbol of the Monkana_sol meme cryptocurrency.</strong> Its creation was inspired by 
                the monkey and its favorite food: the banana, an original creativity with the combination of the monkey 
                and its banana in the Solana meme family. It's truly a first in the crypto ecosystem.
